# QM/MM - best practices

The aim of this ONLINE course is to give an intro to classical Molecular Dynamics 
(MD) simulations and the combined Quantum Mechanical and Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM)
simulations. We will start from scratch by setting a MD simulation, in the first half-day
of the course, and then use this system to setup a QM/MM simulation. Regarding the
software, we will use VMD, NAMD, ORCA, and GAUSSIAN for the full QM/MM protocol.
We will also provide users with a set of best practices to improve the performance of
their simulations.

NOTE: The course will be online!

## Topics to be covered are:

- Setting up classical MD and QM/MM simulations with NAMD+VMD and GAUSSIAN/ORCA
