We will start from scratch by setting a MD simulation, in the first half-day of the course, and then use this system to setup a QM/MM simulation. Regarding the software, we will use VMD, NAMD, ORCA, and GAUSSIAN for the full QM/MM protocol. We will also provide users with a set of best practices to improve the performance of their simulations.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome__to__the__course__qmmm__-__best__practices","text":"The aim of this ONLINE course is to give an intro to classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and the combined Quantum Mechanical and Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) simulations.
